# Migration Plan for ChatterSphere Architecture Restructuring

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for restructuring the ChatterSphere application from a legacy component structure to a modern feature-based architecture. The migration will be executed in phases to ensure minimal disruption to development and production environments.

## Current State Assessment

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Migration Process

1. **Create Feature Directory**
   ```
   src/features/[feature-name]/
   ├── components/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── services/
   ├── types/
   └── utils/
   ```

2. **Move Components**
   - Copy components to new feature directory
   - Update import paths
   - Test functionality
   - Remove old components

3. **Update Imports**
   - Use automated tools where possible
   - Update all references to moved components
   - Test all affected pages

4. **Add Tests**
   - Create unit tests for each service
   - Add integration tests for API routes
   - Implement component tests

### Data Migration

#### User Data
- No schema changes required
- Verify data integrity post-migration

#### Community Data
- Add new indexes for performance
- Implement data archiving for old posts

#### Message Data
- Optimize message storage
- Implement message encryption

## Risk Mitigation

### Development Risks
- **Code Conflicts**: Use feature branches and regular merging
- **Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor metrics throughout migration

### Production Risks
- **Downtime**: Use blue-green deployment strategy
- **Data Loss**: Implement comprehensive backups
- **User Experience**: Roll out features gradually

## Rollback Plan

1. **Database Rollback**
   - Maintain database snapshots before major changes
   - Document rollback procedures for each phase

2. **Code Rollback**
   - Tag stable versions before each phase
   - Maintain previous deployment configurations

3. **Feature Rollback**
   - Implement feature flags for new functionality
   - Ability to disable new features quickly

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test all service layer functions
- Mock external dependencies
- Achieve 80% code coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test API routes with middleware
- Test database operations
- Test authentication flows

### End-to-End Tests
